#projekt_koncowy

Coders Lab Final project:

Sometimes reinventing is just a programming workout, but when I develop this little game, for me it was like back to the childhood. 'SYME-TETRIS' is a Tetris with possibility to chose blocks - of course only symmetric blocks :) 

This is new version of classic, arcade game.

I wrote this one in Vanilla JS(ES6), jQuery and CSS.



Use z,x and arrow keys to control.
